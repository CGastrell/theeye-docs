# Resources

A **_resource_** is a wide concept on the **_core platform_**: it is whatever can report a status. Basically every **_resource_** is a **_monitor_**, but calling it a **_monitor_** doesn't quite cover it.

Take a **_host_** for example: it is an abstract concept, only when a **_host monitor_** reports it's status and health, then the **_host_** becomes a reliable, accountable **_resource_**.

A **_web scrapper_** is a way of monitoring an external website or API, can report a status and, if needed, **_trigger_** **_tasks_** or **_workflows_**. It's an accountable **_resource_** to become a signaling **_monitor event_**.

As you can see, the **_resource_** concept points to be any source of information (thus, decision) on your infrastructure. Complex and dependent processes can be setup though **_resources_** and, as well as it may sound confusing first, it becomes more and more as a comfortable concept for it's defined functionality and schema.
