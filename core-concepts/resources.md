# Resources

A _**resource**_ is a wide concept on the _**core platform**_: it is whatever can report a status. Basically every _**resource**_ is a _**monitor**_, but calling it a _**monitor**_ doesn't quite cover it.

Take a _**host**_ for example: it is an abstract concept, only when a _**host monitor**_ reports it's status and health, then the _**host**_ becomes a reliable, accountable _**resource**_.

A _**web scrapper**_ is a way of monitoring an external website or API, can report a status and, if needed, _**trigger**_ _**tasks**_ or _**workflows**_. It's an accountable _**resource**_ to become a signaling _**monitor event**_.

As you can see, the _**resource**_ concept points to be any source of information \(thus, decision\) on your infrastructure. Complex and dependent processes can be setup though _**resources**_ and, as well as it may sound confusing first, it becomes more and more as a comfortable concept for it's defined functionality and schema.
