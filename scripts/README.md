### Create a Script
![](https://github.com/patobas/docs/blob/master/script.gif)

Scripts can be written directly from a live editor or can be uploaded, as simple as it gets, by droping files in the _Files & Scripts_ creation windows.
The live editor will recognize the notation language (interpreter) once you name the script file and set an extension (e.g. runme.sh).
TheEye will carry out scripts executions over tasks. Bash, Python, Perl, Node and bat files are recognized, but any script can be executed as long as the interpreter is available in the destination host.
