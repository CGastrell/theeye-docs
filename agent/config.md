# SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE

by default not configuration is provided.

configuration is taken from the environment and also could be provided via configuration file.

just replace the configuation file `theeye-agent-root/config/default.js` or `theeye-agent-root/config/default.json`

if you want to use a config and know what else you can do, use the sample file [config.sample.json](https://github.com/theeye-io-team/theeye-docs/blob/master/agent/config.sample.js)
